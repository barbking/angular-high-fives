# Fictional Character High Five-Off - Angular Assignment

In this assignment at Prime, I had to make an app to high-five fictional characters. This was one of my first assignments using Angular.  Each fictional character's skill with high-fiving will be randomly generated. And each high five may or may not work!

## Setup

Run `npm install` to get Express. Angular and Bootstrap are included.
